# Covid-Detection-Machine-Learning
In this project, I implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to detect COVID-19 from a structured dataset (covid_data.csv). The dataset contained patient features and a target variable indicating COVID-19 status.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and standardized features using StandardScaler.
Model Training: Trained models using an 80/20 train-test split.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Accuracy, ROC AUC, and Classification Report.
The Random Forest model achieved the highest performance, showcasing the potential of ensemble methods in classifying COVID-19 cases based on clinical data
